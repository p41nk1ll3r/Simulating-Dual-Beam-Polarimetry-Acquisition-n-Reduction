# Simulating-Dual-Beam-Polarimetry-Acquisition-n-Reduction

This repository includes the script all files that were used in, or resulted from, simulating the interaction of polarized light with an anisotropic detector and applying two different reduction methods to recover the original "signal". Some arrow plots in pdf format are also included.
